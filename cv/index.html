            <p>Achievements and results:
I analyzed the target group, customers, competitors, company, product: 3 mindmaps, several tables. Conversion pages were created, which gave a conversion
rate of up to 23%, and an average of 11%. Participated in sales for writing sales
scripts and greater customer understanding. I had a conversion rate 9% higher
than the latest seller.
I created organizational rules, a training book for sellers, recruiters and new
employees. I set up AMO CRM, telephony, mailing. After six months after
creating the LPs, I worked to optimize them: increased conversion on average
plus 4%, on some pages plus 7%, conducted a dozen A / B tests.
From paper to files ► I have implemented automated document creation: 4
times more efficiency, also needs less time, less errors by limiting human
intervention.
I created the financial accounting for management: constantly collecting data,
three reports are ready at the beginning of the month. I'm relying on analytics.</p>
